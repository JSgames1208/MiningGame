    DIALOGUE SYSTEM
=======================

-- server-authoritative
-- UI -> slice -> DialogueServiceClient -> DialogueServiceServer
    and the other way around.
    using Signal between UI and slice
    using Networker in services on both parties
    server-client communication strictly happens between the services!!!

        Condition IDs:
